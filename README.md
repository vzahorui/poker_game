## Roadmap

1. Add class method to Game class which would allow initializing it with n_players instead of providing a list. 
This will be helpful in simulations.
2. Add buttons to your actions: fold, check, bet. Add some logic preventing bets lower than the current bet used by the opponents.
3. Add some primitive logic to the players.
4. Add table behaviour where a new card is revealed after moving to a new stage.
