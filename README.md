## Roadmap

1. Add class method to Game class which would allow initializing it with n_players instead of providing a list. 
This will be helpful in simulations.
2. Divide the code in main into blocks, probably separate modules.
3. Add a table representing the user moves, the order, who has blind, whether the user has folded.
Use pandas styler for it to highlight the active player (at later stage).
4. Add some text field representing the active player and his action. If it's the last stage of the game then
display the card of the player. OtOtherwise display the back covers of the cards.
5. Display the bank amount
